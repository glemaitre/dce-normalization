\section{Introduction}

\Ac{cap} is the second most frequently diagnosed men cancer, accounting for 899,000 cases leading to 258,100 deaths~\citep{ferlay2010estimates}.
As highlighted by the PI-RADS Steering Committee, the two main challenges to be addressed are~\citep{weinreb2016pi}:
(i) the improvement of detecting clinically significant \ac{cap} and
(ii) an increase of the confidence in benign or dormant cases, avoiding unnecessary invasive medical exams.
In this regard, \ac{mpmri} is frequently used to build robust \ac{cad} systems to detect, localize, and grade \ac{cap}.
In general, \ac{cad} systems are based on \ac{mpmri} which potentially combines several of the following modalities~\citep{lemaitre2015computer}: \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, \ac{adc} maps, and \ac{mrsi}.

In \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, a contrast media is injected intravenously and a set of images is acquired over time.
Consequently, each voxel in an image corresponds to a dynamic signal which is related to both contrast agent concentration and the vascular properties of the tissue.
Therefore, changes of the enhanced signal allows to discriminate healthy from \ac{cap} tissues.
In fact, these properties are automatically extracted using quantitative or semi-quantitative approaches~\citep{lemaitre2015computer}.

\emph{Quantitative} approaches uses pharmacokinetic modelling based on a bicompartment model, namely Brix~\citep{brix1991pharmacokinetic} and Tofts~\citep{tofts1995quantitative} models.
The parameters of the Brix model are inferred assuming a linear relationship between the media concentration and the \ac{mri} signal intensity.
This assumption has shown, however, to lead to inaccurately estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters~\citep{heilmann2006determination}.
In the contrary, Tofts model requires a conversion from \ac{mri} signal intensity to concentration, which become a non-linear relationship using specific equation of \ac{mri} sequences (e.g., FLASH sequence).
Tofts modelling suffers, however, from an higher complexity~\citep{gliozzi2011phenomenological}.
Indeed, the conversion using the non-linear approach requires to acquire a T$_1$ map which is not always possible during clinical examination.
Additionally, the parameter calculation requires the \ac{aif} which is challenging to measure and can also lead to inaccurate estimation.

\emph{Semi-quantitative} approaches are rather mathematical than pharmacokinetic modelling~\citep{huisman2001accurate,gliozzi2011phenomenological}.
These methods offer the advantages to not require any knowledge about the \ac{mri} sequence nor any conversion from signal intensity to concentration.
However, the heuristic approach propose by \citeauthor{huisman2001accurate} requires an estimate regarding the noise standard deviation of the signal as well as manual tuning.

Nevertheless, all presented methods suffer from two major drawbacks:
(i) inter-patient variability and (ii) loss of information.
The inter-patient variability is mainly due to the acquisition process and consequently lead to generalization issue while applying machine learning algorithm.
All previous methods extract few discriminative parameters to describe the \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} signal which might lead to a loss of information.
%(i) the inter-patient variability of the data lead to a variation of the parameters estimated and subsequently to poor classification performance while designing \ac{cad} systems, and
%(ii) only few parameters are used to characterize the dynamic signal implying that some information are discarded.

In this work, we propose a fully automatic normalization method for \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} that reduce the inter-patient variability of the data.
The benefit of our approach will be shown while using quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches.
Additionally, we show that using the whole normalized \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} signal is preferable to quantitative and semi-quantitative methods, leading to the best classification performance.
