\section{Discussions}\label{sec:discussions}

The experiments conducted in the previous section can give rise to several discussions.
In Tofts quantification, two different approaches have been used to infer the pharmacokinetic parameters: using a population-based or a patient-based \ac{aif}.
The patient-based \ac{aif} approach leads to better classification performance.
However, there are two shortcomings to take into account while advancing this fact:
(i) T$_{10}$ parameter has been fixed and not computed from a T$_1$ map and
(ii) the population-based \ac{aif} has been estimated from a cohort of only 17 patients.
These two limitations have to be considered while advancing that population-based \ac{aif} modelling is outperforming patient-based \ac{aif} modelling.

The best classification performance is reached by normalizing the \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} data and use the entire enhanced signal as feature, emphasizing the fact that a \emph{loss of information} while extracting quantitative parameters.
Furthermore, this normalization is a less complex process than all
quantification methods and significantly improves the classification
performance of the semi-quantitative approach ($p=0.001$) proposed by
\citeauthor{huisman2001accurate}.
Additionally, our normalization improves the \ac{auc} score related to
the detection of \ac{cap} in \ac{cg}, also known to be the most
challenging cases in the diagnosis of \ac{cap}.

However, using the entire enhanced signal in conjunction with the
normalization suffers from one drawback: the training time of the
\ac{rf} classifier increases; instead of using $3$ to $5$ features, the
feature space becomes a $40$ dimensions space. The extraction of the
semi-quantitative parameters leads to a comparable classification performance ---
$0.655$ vs. $0.666$ --- and should be chosen as the alternative method to
consider if the number of feature in the classification is
critical. Despite this fact, the benefit of the normalization method
has been shown for both methods.

Nevertheless, this study is performed on a small cohort of patients using a single \ac{mri} machine.
Generalizing the results of this study on a larger dataset acquired from different commercial systems have to be considered to study the robustness of the proposed approach.
Additionally, our method being non-parametric should provide an
adequate framework to process \ac{dce} data from different
institutions, scanners with different settings.
